## Argument

I started with the login functions with firebase because that felt like it was the hardest part to tackle for me.

The tutorial that helped me with this part: [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwu15ldZ7k)

When I was done with the login part, I started with creating all the components and all the pages for the app.
I then started with the add item function which became the part of the project that I spent most time on, partly because it is the page that needs to be as bug free and fluid as possible, and partly because I didn’t have much experience with forms and firebase.

The tutorial that helped me with this part: [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt4757glfbhGMJ9LxziIBKkUVAKQoVHn6)

I was never really “done” with the add item page but when I felt good with it, I started with the storage and shopping list pages because those are very simple to program.
I started with hard coding the storages and a few items to get the feel of the app.
But then started learning more on how to use firebase and quickly implemented the ability to add items to the database.
Then I added the storages as well to the database.

The tutorial that helped me with this part: [Tutorial 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvP4h6O2x8)

When that was done, I added a snackbar and accordion. Then I started with the shopping list.
Then the buttons for each item in storage and shopping list tabs.
And lastly, I made the account page with a support tab. 
When I felt that the app was usable, I started bug fixing and some small CSS fixes.
